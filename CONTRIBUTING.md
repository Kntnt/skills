# Contributing to Kntnt Skills

Thanks for considering a contribution. kntnt/skills is open source, so anyone is free to fork it and adapt it for their own purposes. This document describes the *project norm* — what kinds of contribution are likely to be welcomed into the upstream repository at [Kntnt/skills](https://github.com/Kntnt/skills). It is editorial guidance on what is likely to be merged, not a legal restriction on what you may do with the code.

## Contribution scope

| Category | Examples | Reception |
|---|---|---|
| Welcomed without question | Bug reports; bug fixes against existing behaviour; corrections to broken examples; typo and grammar fixes in prose; clarifications that do not change behaviour. | Open a PR. If the change is small and self-evidently correct, it is usually merged quickly. |
| Accepted but discussed first | New features; changes to existing behaviour, scope, or a public interface; new dependencies. | Open an issue first to align on intent before writing code. A PR without prior discussion may still land, but expect feedback rounds. |
| Unlikely to be merged but free to fork | Changes that alter the project's direction or restructure its architecture in a way that conflicts with its goals. | The licence makes forking explicit and lawful. If you want a different direction, build it in your fork. |

## Inbound licensing

By submitting a contribution, you agree it is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 by virtue of its §5 *Submission of Contributions* — any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion is under the terms of that licence unless you state otherwise. No separate contributor licence agreement is required.

## Behaviour

Be respectful and constructive in issues, pull requests, and discussions. Assume good faith, keep criticism about the work rather than the person, and help keep this a project people want to contribute to.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for anything in the *discussed* row above. For *welcomed* items, you can open a PR directly. Use the issue tracker at <https://github.com/Kntnt/skills/issues>.
2. **One concern per PR.** Smaller PRs land faster.
3. **Follow the project's coding standard.** It is materialised under [`docs/coding-standard/`](docs/coding-standard/) — read `general.md` plus the module(s) for the language or framework you touch before changing code.
4. **Regenerate the catalog** when you change any file of a skill the catalog names — anything under `skills/<category>/<skill>/`. Each entry carries a content digest of that skill's directory, so a catalog left as it was no longer describes the skills. The manager under `skills/kntnt/` is no catalog entry and carries no digest, so its own files are not part of one:

   ```
   KNTNT_SOURCE=. uv run skills/kntnt/scripts/kntnt.py catalog --write
   ```

   Nothing is authored by hand and no version is bumped — the digest is computed from the files. The fourth check below fails on a catalog that has fallen behind.

   Because that digest is computed over the files' bytes, the repository pins line endings to LF in `.gitattributes` — a checkout that normalises them would regenerate every digest and fail that same check.
5. **Run the tests.** The Python engines under `skills/<category>/<skill>/scripts/` are covered by a pytest suite under `tests/`. Four commands verify a change, each provisioning its tool through `uv`:

   ```
   uvx ruff check .
   uvx ruff format --check .
   uvx --with types-PyYAML mypy skills/kntnt/scripts/kntnt.py skills/code/commit/scripts/ship.py skills/code/orchestrate/scripts/run.py tests
   uv run --with pytest --with pyyaml pytest
   ```

   The manager's script declares PyYAML in its PEP 723 block, so `uv run` gives it that package on its own; the last two commands name it because they do not go through the script — mypy needs the stubs, and the tests import the script into their own interpreter.

   These are the same four checks CI runs on every pull request, so a green run locally means a green run there.
